    "\n",
    "Welcome to an introduction to **AISQL** (Artificial Intelligence SQL), Snowflake's powerful feature that allows you to query your data using natural language instead of complex SQL syntax. In this template, you'll learn how AISQL can transform the way you interact with data by enabling conversational queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "- How to use AISQL for natural language data queries\n",
    "- Practical examples using movie and ratings data\n",
    "- Benefits of AISQL for business users and analysts\n",
    "- Best practices for writing effective natural language queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context\n",
    "Movie streaming services and entertainment companies analyze vast amounts of data to understand viewer preferences, identify trending content, and make data-driven decisions. Traditional SQL analysis requires technical expertise, but AISQL democratizes data analysis by allowing business users to ask questions in plain English.\n",

    "### 🎯 **Best Practices**\n",
    "- **Be Specific**: Use clear, descriptive language in your questions\n",
    "- **Use Context**: Reference table and column names when helpful\n",
    "- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic questions and build complexity gradually\n",
    "- **Be Conversational**: Ask questions as you would to a human analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Example Natural Language Questions for AISQL**\n",
    "- \"Show me the top 10 movies by IMDB rating\"\n",
    "- \"What's the average box office for sci-fi movies?\"\n",
    "- \"Which director has the highest average movie rating?\"\n",
    "- \"Find movies from 2010 to 2020 with ratings above 8.5\"\n",
    "- \"What's the total box office for Christopher Nolan movies?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **When to Use AISQL vs Traditional SQL**\n",
