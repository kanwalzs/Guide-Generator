Please create a task for every step in `prompts/tasks` and follow the steps one by one to create the template based on user inputs.

You don't need to read the steps prompts details for now. 

Please make sure to inlude re-reading the step document in each TODO task. For example, the first task could be "Plan the template for <template_id>; re-read `prompts/tasks/step1-template-planning.md`".

Please pay attention to the order of the steps. Smaller step number should be created as an earlier task. e.g.
- step 1 is the first task.
- step 2 is the next task.
- step 3 is the next task.
- step 3.5 is the next task.
- step 4 is the next task.
- etc.
