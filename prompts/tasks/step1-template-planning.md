# Step 1: Template Planning

## Context
Read the following files to refresh your memory / context:
- `prompts/new-template-generation-workflow.md`
- `prompts/template-requirements.md`

## Objective
Read user inputs and template generation requirements. Draft a high-level plan for structuring the template, covering what will be included, the steps, background story, and materials. Revise user input into a concrete template idea. 

## Process
1. Analyze user inputs (feature, audience, format)
   - Be sure to read any reference document, website mentioned in the user input. 
   - Please also run at least one additional general web search by yourself to valid your understanding the demonstrating feature in the template, since your knowledge may very likely be outdated. 
2. Review template requirements and guidelines
3. Draft high-level plan (title, steps, business context, data needs)

## Output
Template concept document with clear scope and structure. The high-level plan should be placed as `generated-templates/<template_id>/plan.md`

## Notes
Do not drop any external references that were mentioned in the user inputs.
