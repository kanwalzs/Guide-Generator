# Step 4: Streamlit Assessment

## Objective
Decide if Streamlit snippets are needed (typically for Notebook templates). If not needed, skip Steps 5-6.

## Input
- Template concept from Step 1
- Validated core code from Step 3

## Process
Evaluate if template needs:
- Data visualization
- Interactive exploration
- Dashboard functionality
- User interface components

Please be aware that most notebook templates do no need a streamlit section. 

Here are examples that need streamlit sections
- A template requirement that explicitly asks to demonstrate Streamlit features.
- Cortex Analytics: which only offers a REST api to query, and returns a JSON response that needs to be parsed and visualized.
- GEO features, which requires streamlit to demonstrate the ability of visualizing coordinates on a map. 

## Output
Decision: Include Streamlit (proceed to Step 5) or Skip (proceed to Step 7)
