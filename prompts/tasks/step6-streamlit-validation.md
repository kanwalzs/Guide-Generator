# Step 6: Streamlit Validation (If Generated)

**THIS STEP IS NOT WORKING AND REQUIRES EXTRA WORK!!**

## Objective
Validate Streamlit snippets work correctly.

## Input
- Streamlit code from Step 5
- Core code from Step 3 (with data preserved)

## Process
1. Execute data setup from Step 3 **without cleanup**
2. Test Streamlit snippets render correctly
3. Verify no runtime errors

## Output
Validated Streamlit components: `generated-templates/<template_id>/streamlit_code.py` updated and confirmed working
