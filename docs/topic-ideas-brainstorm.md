# Snowflake Template Topic Ideas (Brainstorm)

*Generated topic ideas for Snowflake learning templates. Goal: 100-200 concise ideas across all user personas.*

## User Personas
- **Data Analyst**: Business-focused analytics and reporting
- **Data Engineer**: ETL, pipelines, data architecture  
- **ML Engineer**: Machine learning workflows and AI features
- **Business Analyst**: Business intelligence and insights
- **Administrator**: Account management, security, optimization

## 🎯 **Enhanced Template Strategy**

**Philosophy**: Create comprehensive, integrated templates that combine multiple Snowflake capabilities around realistic business use cases, rather than isolated single-feature demos.

**Key Principles**:
- **Multi-capability Integration**: Each template should showcase 3-5 related Snowflake features working together
- **Realistic Business Context**: Use practical scenarios like customer review analysis, sales forecasting, etc.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, then layer on additional capabilities
- **Cross-functional Value**: Appeal to multiple user personas within one template

**Example - Comprehensive Customer Review Analysis**:
Instead of separate templates for each AI function, create one rich template that:
- Analyzes sentiment (positive/negative classification)
- Detects languages in multilingual reviews
- Summarizes reviews (overall + by sentiment)
- Translates content to different languages
- Extracts entities (product features, complaints)
- Builds chatbot for review Q&A using Cortex Search
- Moderates content for inappropriate material
- Visualizes insights with integrated dashboards

**Example - Advanced Time Series Analytics**:
Combine multiple analytical capabilities:
- Anomaly detection in sales patterns
- Predictive forecasting using built-in ML
- Seasonal trend decomposition
- Performance alerting and monitoring
- Real-time dashboard updates

This approach creates more engaging, practical templates that better demonstrate Snowflake's integrated ecosystem.
