# High-level idea

Work with geospatial data using Snowflake's GEOGRAPHY and GEOMETRY data types to perform location-based analytics and spatial queries.

# Feature details & references

Show how to:
- Store and query GEOGRAPHY/GEOMETRY data
- Perform spatial joins and filters
- Calculate distances and areas
- Work with H3 hexagonal indexing
- Visualize geospatial data
- Optimize spatial queries with indexing

* [Geospatial Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-geospatial)

# Test data setup

Create store locations, delivery routes, and customer addresses. Use TPC-H nation/region data enhanced with coordinates.

# Format

Use snowflake notebook.

# Length

Normal.

# Additional notes

Include examples of common use cases: proximity search, geofencing, route optimization, and territory management.
