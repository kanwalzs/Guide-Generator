# High-level idea

Enable and optimize Query Acceleration Service to automatically improve performance of large table scans and complex queries.

# Feature details & references

Show how to:
- Enable query acceleration on warehouses
- Monitor acceleration eligibility
- Analyze query acceleration metrics
- Optimize for acceleration patterns
- Manage costs and scale factors
- Compare with other optimization techniques
