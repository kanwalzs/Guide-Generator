# High-level idea

Internal marketplace is private, organization-only storefront where teams within the same company can publish, discover, and consume internal data products, apps, and AI assets. It functions similarly to the public Snowflake Marketplace but is scoped entirely for internal use.
By listing data on Internal Marketplace, you provide rich metadata, access controls, and ownership details. This helps teams across your organization discover trusted data and query with confidence.
